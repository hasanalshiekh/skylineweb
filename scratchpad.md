## Latest Task: Mobile Navbar Visibility Fix ✅

### What was accomplished:
- **Fixed Header Visibility**: Added explicit CSS rules to ensure header remains visible on mobile devices
- **Mobile Media Query Enhancement**: Added `position: fixed !important`, `display: block !important`, and `visibility: visible !important` to header
- **Cross-Device Compatibility**: Applied fixes to both tablet (768px) and mobile phone (480px) media queries
- **Cross-Page Consistency**: Applied visibility fixes to both index.html and about.html
- **Positioning Override**: Used `!important` declarations to override any conflicting CSS that might hide the header
- **Z-Index Maintenance**: Maintained proper z-index hierarchy with header (1000) staying below mobile menu (9999)

### Technical Improvements:
- **CSS Override Strategy**: Used `!important` declarations to ensure header visibility overrides any conflicting styles
- **Multi-Device Support**: Applied fixes across different screen sizes (768px and 480px breakpoints)
- **Position Enforcement**: Explicitly set `position: fixed` to ensure header stays at top of viewport
- **Display Guarantee**: Added `display: block` and `visibility: visible` to prevent header from being hidden
- **Cross-Page Implementation**: Applied identical fixes to both index.html and about.html for consistency

### Mobile Menu Features:
- **Hamburger Button**: Animated 3-line button that transforms to X when active (z-index: 10000)
- **Transparent Overlay**: Semi-transparent gradient background with blur effect (z-index: 9999)
- **Background Visibility**: Content behind menu is visible through transparency
- **Smooth Transitions**: Fade in/out animations for better UX
- **Auto-Close**: Closes when clicking links or outside the menu
- **Responsive**: Automatically adjusts based on screen size
- **Touch Optimized**: Large touch targets for mobile devices
- **Slider Compatible**: Always appears above slider content when active

## Lessons Learned
- Always test mobile navigation on actual devices
- Use `!important` sparingly but effectively for responsive overrides
- Ensure proper z-index management for overlays
- Consider touch interactions when designing mobile interfaces
- Test menu functionality across different screen sizes and orientations
- Transparency with rgba() provides better visual hierarchy than solid overlays
- Backdrop-filter blur works well with semi-transparent backgrounds for modern UX
- Z-index hierarchy is crucial for mobile menu functionality, especially with complex layouts

## Next Steps
- [ ] Test on various mobile devices and browsers
- [ ] Consider adding swipe gestures for menu control
- [ ] Optimize performance for slower mobile devices
- [ ] Add ARIA labels for better accessibility
