## Latest Task: Mobile Navbar Z-Index Enhancement ✅

### What was accomplished:
- **Enhanced Header Z-Index**: Increased header z-index from 1000 to 9998 to ensure it appears above slider
- **Slider Z-Index Management**: Added explicit z-index: 1 to slider container and slider elements
- **Mobile Menu Button Enhancement**: Added position: relative to mobile menu button for better positioning
- **JavaScript Visibility Enhancement**: Added ensureNavbarVisibility() function to dynamically enforce navbar visibility
- **Cross-Page Implementation**: Applied z-index improvements to both index.html and about.html
- **Event-Driven Updates**: Added load and resize event listeners to ensure navbar visibility on all screen changes
- **Hierarchy Optimization**: Established proper z-index hierarchy: mobile button (10000) > mobile menu (9999) > header (9998) > slider (1)

### Technical Improvements:
- **Z-Index Hierarchy Management**: Properly layered all UI elements with specific z-index values
- **Dynamic JavaScript Enforcement**: Added runtime checks to ensure navbar visibility on all devices
- **Slider Compatibility**: Explicitly set slider z-index to prevent overlap with navbar
- **Mobile Button Positioning**: Enhanced mobile menu button positioning for better accessibility
- **Event-Driven Responsiveness**: Added event listeners for load and resize to handle dynamic screen changes
- **Cross-Page Consistency**: Applied identical z-index improvements to both pages
- **Performance Optimization**: Used efficient DOM queries and style updates

### Mobile Menu Features:
- **Hamburger Button**: Animated 3-line button that transforms to X when active (z-index: 10000)
- **Transparent Overlay**: Semi-transparent gradient background with blur effect (z-index: 9999)
- **Background Visibility**: Content behind menu is visible through transparency
- **Smooth Transitions**: Fade in/out animations for better UX
- **Auto-Close**: Closes when clicking links or outside the menu
- **Responsive**: Automatically adjusts based on screen size
- **Touch Optimized**: Large touch targets for mobile devices
- **Slider Compatible**: Always appears above slider content when active

## Lessons Learned
- Always test mobile navigation on actual devices
- Use `!important` sparingly but effectively for responsive overrides
- Ensure proper z-index management for overlays
- Consider touch interactions when designing mobile interfaces
- Test menu functionality across different screen sizes and orientations
- Transparency with rgba() provides better visual hierarchy than solid overlays
- Backdrop-filter blur works well with semi-transparent backgrounds for modern UX
- Z-index hierarchy is crucial for mobile menu functionality, especially with complex layouts

## Next Steps
- [ ] Test on various mobile devices and browsers
- [ ] Consider adding swipe gestures for menu control
- [ ] Optimize performance for slower mobile devices
- [ ] Add ARIA labels for better accessibility
